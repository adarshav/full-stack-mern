/*2. Create a class called Book to represent a book. A Book should include four pieces of information as instance variables‚Äêa book name, an ISBN number, an author name and a publisher. Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four instance variables. Provide a method named getBookInfo that returns the description of the book as a String (the description should include all the information about the book). You should use this keyword in member methods and constructor.
